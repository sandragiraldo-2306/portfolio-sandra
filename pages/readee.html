              <h1>Readee - iOS - Reading app</h1>
              <h3 class="py-3">Part 1: Creating the MVP for a reading app ~ a UX case study</h3>
              <p>This is the year 2020. Technology is present in everything we do and it is reachable at any moment from our smartphones. We use it from the moment we wake up (using an alarm application) to the moment we go to bed at night (turning off our lights from our phones). Everything is so simple using this little mind extension, it keeps us informed, entertained, and connected with the people we love. It also keeps us in good shape, well‚Ä¶ as long as our motivation and loyalty to an app last, and nowadays, with the app profusion, it‚Äôs not obvious neither easy‚Ä¶</p>
              <blockquote py-5>
                <p>Even though there are a lot of health and wellness applications in the market today, people continue struggling to achieve a healthy lifestyle.</p>
              </blockquote>
  
              <!-- <figure>

              </figure> -->
  
              <h3>The intro</h3>
              <p>The Wellness Institute noticed this behavior in today‚Äôs consumers and decided to leverage this technology to improve the way people are living their day to day lives and to help them achieve a more successful and meaningful existence through a digital solution.</p>
  
              <h3>The goal</h3>
              <p>The goal of this project was to propose a new mobile solution that would motivate and push users to commit to a healthier life through a wellness application and to stay committed. This app should have a progress tracking system to keep the users informed of their status and goals achievement.</p>
  
              <h3>The scope</h3>
              <p>To start, my colleague and I decided to tackle this situation from a mental health point of view. We were interested in knowing how important it was for people to define, write and achieve goals in their everyday lives. From something as simple as drinking water every morning to something more complicated such as quitting smoking.
              </p>
              
              <p>Based on research done by the American Psychological Association, people who are optimistic and persistent in pursuing their goals tend to have better day to day lives.</p>
              <p class="aside">
                Top highlight
              </p>
  
              <h2>The User research</h2>
              <h3>Surveys</h3>
              <p>To understand more about how important it was for people to set up goals, we conducted a survey. 50 participants shared with us their opinions and personal insights when defining and achieving a goal. The survey results showcased that even though 92% of the participants thought having goals was important, 21% didn‚Äôt achieve them for lack of motivation and organization. <br>
              The survey also showed that out of 18 topics ‚Äúreading more‚Äù arrived in third place, and that was the main trigger for us to propose a new reading application.</p>
              
              <h3>Market Analysis</h3>
              <p>After having defined the type of application we wanted to propose, we conducted a market analysis and we found out that people spent over $101 billion on apps globally in 2018, and only 2.92% of this number went to reading applications. We were surprised by this number and decided to analyze people‚Äôs reviews for existing reading apps in platforms such as google play and app store. <br>
              We realized people were not very happy about the reading applications that are on the market. They thought these apps were either too expensive for the number of books and variety they offered, or too complicated to use because of the constant bugs.</p>
  
              <h3>JTBD</h3>
              <p>With this collected information and after having identified a way to help people live a healthier life through goal accomplishment and reading, we conducted Jobs To Be Done interviews to collect qualitative data from 4 people. Here are the main takeouts:</p>
              
              <figure>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*eHm_W0WIGFIgFVCwaNzePQ.png" width="80%">
              </figure>
  
              <ul>
                <li>People are not reading because they always find something else to do like watch a Netflix series or scroll through their social media apps.</li>
                <li>People feel lost when trying to find the right book to read based on their preferences.</li>
                <li>People like reading books that have been recommended by friends or by people they look up to.</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h3>Reframing the problem</h3>
              <p>After analyzing all the data collected during the user research phase, we were able to define the main persona for our reading app.</p>
  
              <figure>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*JhZn41MbayEGNFOSFecPiw.jpeg" alt="" width="60%">
              </figure>
  
              <p>We also summarized the user research and the user needs in the following problem statement.</p>
  
              <blockquote>
                <h4>Sophie, a social accountant, and commuter needs to be encouraged to read more, and to be guided to choose the right book because she doesn‚Äôt have the reflex to start reading, even though she wants to be motivated by the stories of inspiring people.</h4>
              </blockquote>
  
              <h3>The solution</h3>
              <p>With the problem statement defined we started imagining features for the future application. After having used different ideation techniques such as ‚Äúbad and good ideas‚Äù, and ‚Äúcrazy 8‚Äôs‚Äù we came up with 20 different features.</p>
  
              <figure>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*vRi-VJAEBc8iOEv2JvKRJQ.png" alt="" width="80%">
              </figure>
  
              <p>To decide which features were the most important we did the ‚ÄúMoscow method‚Äù and ‚Äúbuy a feature‚Äù sessions with 5 people. Here are the 9 features that were priorities and that we decided to implement in the first MVP of our reading app.</p>
  
              <h3>The features</h3>
              <h4>Reading progress</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Set-up goals & reading preferences</li>
                <li>Progression tracker</li>
                <li>Survey when a book is finished to narrow down suggestions</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h4>Reading encouragement:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Receive a notification when stop reading for a few days, with a teaser of the next chapter</li>
                <li>Indicator when you are close to the end of the book</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h4>Book club features:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Get book recommendations from your friends</li>
                <li>Follow people that inspire you</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h4>Augmented:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Comments from authors in the book</li>
                <li>Highlight a text extract and save or share it</li>
              </ul>
  
              <h3>The application flow</h3>
              <p>To concretize the features that had been prioritized in the previous phase we created a user flow. It helped us visualized the user using our application and to focus on the main flows.</p>
  
              <figure>

              </figure>
  
              <h3 py-5>The conclusion:</h3>
              <h4>Usability testing</h4>
              <p>We conducted usability tests of our prototype with 5 people and here are the results:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All users found the navigation easy to follow and loved the network feature and found the tracker and library pictograms a little confusing.</li>
                <li>3 out of 5 thought the goal tracker system was too complicated.</li>
                <li>2 out of 5 thought the search and recommendation features could be improved.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Key metrics:</h4>
              <p>In shorter-term (1 month):</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Redesign mid-fi prototypes based on usability test feedbacks.</li>
                <li>Run usability tests and iterate.</li>
                <li>Move on UI when the prototype has been validated.</li>
              </ul>
  
              <p>One year after the launch, our goals are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Having 50% of users use the app 3x/week ‚Äî for the first 3 months.</li>
                <li>Having a 4 stars rate minimum in the app store.</li>
                <li>90% of comments left in the app store and google play are positive.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                <p>Achieving a personal goal such as getting into the habit of reading on a daily basis or quitting smoking are decisions that require a lot of motivation and self-determination. You don‚Äôt only need to commit, but to keep this commitment for as long as it takes. For this, you need the right tools and resources to keep you motivated and focused on accomplishing your goal and that‚Äôs what we want to achieve with our reading application.</p>
